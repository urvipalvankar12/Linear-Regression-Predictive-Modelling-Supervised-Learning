# Predictive-Modelling---Linear-Regression

My dog, Banksy, is a very good boy (of course, everyone would like to believe their dog is the best behaved). When I take Banksy on walks he is always (okay, well, mostly) well‐behaved. When other people walk him, they claim that he barks at other dogs, pulls on the leash, eats bread off the sidewalk, and various other kinds of 'misbehaving'. In general, they don't believe that Banksy is half as good as I say he is, which is really a shame.

Being a data‐driven dog owner, I have been collecting data on each walk including the number of 'incidents', the length of the walk, the number of other dogs encountered, whether we encountered a mailman, the number of squirrels, the number of fire‐hydrants passed, and the general time of day.
Using the data provided, help me prove to everyone that Banksy is in fact a good boy.

a) Building a model to predict the Number of Incidents on any given walk
b)	I believe that Banksy may be better behaved specifically when I walk him vs. when anyone else walks him. Conducting a test to see if this is the case. 
c)	Conducting a Chow (chow) test to determine if there is any difference at all when someone else walks Banksy. 
d)	Suppose the last 30 observations I'm actually walking Banksy with another person. Extending the Chow test logic to test for any difference between the three scenarios  (i.e., me alone, someone else alone, me & someone else together).
